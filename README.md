This repository contains all tasks completed as part of the CodeX Internship Program. The internship focused on applying Python, data analysis, natural language processing, and AI model integration to build practical applications.

# Tasks Completed
## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.

Handled missing values and outliers.

Conducted statistical analysis and summary reporting.

Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Extracted key insights and trends from the dataset.

Focus: Understanding dataset behavior, identifying patterns, and summarizing insights.

## 2. Speech-to-Image Generation

A Python application that:

Captures speech input (Telugu or English).

Converts speech to text using Google Speech Recognition.

Translates Telugu text to English using Googletrans.

Generates an AI image using Stable Diffusion (Diffusers).

Libraries used:

speech_recognition

googletrans

diffusers

torch

pillow (PIL)

Focus: Combining speech processing, translation, and generative AI image models.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis Web Application
